# SQL Injection

Welcome to the SQL injection section. Here I will document my solutions for all the labs from the PortSwigger Academy related to this topic. I hope they are helpful to you!

## Introduction

SQL injection (SQLi) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. It generally allows an attacker to view data that they are not normally able to retrieve. This might include data belonging to other users, or any other data that the application itself is able to access. In many cases, an attacker can modify or delete this data, causing persistent changes to the application's content or behavior.
