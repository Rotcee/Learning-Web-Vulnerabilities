# End of the SQL Injection Section

Excellent work making it to the end of the SQL Injection labs. You've tackled everything from basic UNION attacks to advanced blind and out-of-band exploitation techniques.

This is a huge step, but the learning journey never truly ends. It's now up to you to continue building on this foundation.

I hope you found these solutions helpful. See you in the next section!
